    <div id="tabs-1">This is one of the most damaging practices in dog breeding.
        Inbreeding increases the chances of puppies inheriting recessive genes, which can result in many different health problems.
        This practice has devastating consequences regarding the genetic health of the offspring.</div>
    <div id="tabs-2">Genetic disorders often arise in the form of hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, heart defects, skin problems, narcolepsy, and epilepsy. 
        Reduced litter sizes and fertility are more common in inbred dogs. 
        The pain and suffering endured by these dogs are immense and treatment is very expensive.</div>
    <div id="tabs-3">The desire for “pure-bred” dogs results in a lack of genetic diversity.
        This results in breeds becoming more vulnerable to genetic diseases.
        Male dogs used to produce large numbers of puppies, contribute to this reduction, leading to an increase in inbreeding and the propagation of undesirable genetic traits.</div>
    <div id="tabs-4">Dogs are selectively bred to fit specific looks.
        These extreme features often cause breathing difficulties, mobility issues, and several other severe health problems.
        The breeding to meet these often-unrealistic standards can be considered unethical breeding,
         as it prioritizes appearance over the animal’s health and happiness.</div>
    <div id="tabs-5">Backyard breeders and puppy mill operators often prioritize quantity over quality, leading to neglected animals, poor living conditions, and a complete disregard for the dog’s welfare.
        These animals often may not receive the right amount of veterinary care and could suffer from congenital defects, parasites, and even deadly diseases such as parvovirus.</div>
    <div id="tabs-6">    It is crucial to understand the behavioral changes that can occur after mating and breeding in both male and female dogs.
        The behavior of a male dog after mating often varies significantly. 
        While the act is a natural behavior, hormonal changes and post-mating behaviors can influence a dog’s temperament. Some male dogs might become more restless or show increased territoriality, while others may remain largely unchanged.
        It’s vital to monitor a male dog’s behavior and ensure he is not becoming excessively aggressive or anxious.
        Female dogs may also experience significant behavioral changes post-mating. 
        They may become restless and exhibit nesting behaviors, seeking quiet and comfortable spaces. 
        Some may also become more affectionate, while others may become more withdrawn.
        It is vital to provide a nurturing and safe environment for pregnant and post-partum female dogs.</div>
    <div id="tabs-7">Ethical dog breeders rarely have excess puppies. 
        If they do, they take care of the unsold puppies until they find suitable homes. 
        However, backyard breeders and puppy mill operators may neglect unsold puppies, turn them over to rescues and shelters, or give them away, often to unideal environments. 
        These operations prioritize financial gain over animal welfare, leading to the suffering and neglect of countless dogs.</div>
    <div id="tabs-8">    Breeding female dogs too frequently can have detrimental impacts on their health. 
        Veterinarians generally recommend waiting until a female dog is two years old before breeding, and then only breeding her once per year at most, and not over consecutive heat cycles.
         Ideally, a female dog should have no more than three to four litters over her entire lifetime. 
        Over breeding can lead to reproductive issues, exhaustion, and increased risk of health complications.</div>

<p class="introduction">My name is Leia and I have loved animals my whole life.
 I grew up with dogs, both big and small, and I got to see them grow up, however I also had to see them suffer from many health issues.
And for a short period of time, I worked at a pet store in puppy sales. 
I witnessed many examples of sick puppies possibly relating to how they were bred and being cared for. These experiences opened a deep curiosity within me. This website's purpose is to inform others about this serious problem.</p>
