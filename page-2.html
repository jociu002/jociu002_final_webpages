<h1 class="title">Questions & Answers</h1>
<h2 class="q-1">What does "inbreeding" in dogs mean?</h2>
    <p class="answer-1">- Inbreeding is when breeders mate dogs that are closely related, such as siblings or parents with offspring. 
    It increase the chances of puppies inheriting harmful recessive genes.</p>
<h2 class="q-2">How can I identify a “backyard” breeder?</h2>
    <p class="answer-2">- Signs include: selling dogs online on sites like Craigslist, Ebay, or Facebook. 
    They often offer minimal medical security, lacking proof of genetic testing, not offering return policies, failing to provide vet records, and selling puppies before they are 8 weeks old.</p>

    <div class="how-to"><p>When looking to find a puppy of your own, it’s crucial to do plenty of research to figure out which breed is the best fit for you, but also which breeder you'd like to work with. 
        In dog breeding, experience is very important. The longer a breeder has been breeding dogs, the most experience they have. Often times, looking through their social media pages or websites will help you to understand the breeder’s reputation. 
        However, don’t discredit a breeder just because they are new and having their first litter. If the breeder is doing things ethically, they usually have an established mentor to guide them. Be sure to research their mentor as extensively as the breeder themself.</p>
        <p>Healthy Habits Before and After Birth:
        “Dogs are living beings, and as a result, breeders can’t control everything that happens with them. Nature can be cruel, and sometimes unforeseen health issues develop in the most carefully contemplated breedings. What breeders can do is ensure that the dogs in their breeding programs are as healthy as possible”(AKC).
        Health screenings such as hip x-rays and blood tests can confirm that a dog is free of disease. DNA, or genetic testing can also determine if a dog is a carrier for a disease or disorder. Knowing the genetic makeup of the dog  can help the breeder successfully prevent a disease from manifesting. 
        Breeders can simply breed carriers to non-carriers without any chance of disease manifesting.
        “Organizations such as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, or OFA, maintain databases of the tests that breeders do on their dogs. 
        Be sure to look not just for your potential puppy’s parents, but their siblings and ancestors. </p>
       <p>Ideally, you’d see evidence of a long-established family of dogs with documented health testing that goes back for many generations. 
        However, there may be exceptions, such as with dogs that are imported and have no health ancestry information, or with regards to relatively new tests (for which there won’t be generations of information) or ones that are newly overseen by the OFA”(AKC).
        Ethical breeders all have the same goal in mind, to produce healthy and behaviorally stable dogs that meet the breed standard.
        In conclusion, be well-informed and ask questions to potential breeders who are actively marketing puppies.</p>
